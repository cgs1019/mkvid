immediate todos:
  expand data schema
  automate database backup asap
  decide on wire format (json/protobuf/capnproto/thrift)
  figure out sessions -- end when tab closed for now?
  session storage -- db for now? then what?
  minimum viable secure auth -- punt on "remember me"?

color picker:
  grid
  start with various hues
  clicking one centers it and shows related variations 
  can drag one we like to a palette
  back/forward history buttons
  integrate with standard (?) yarn/thread color codes?

pattern types:
  cross-stitch - grid-based, easiest
  embroidery - free-form, silk-stitch, etc. trickier (basically vector gfx?)
  crochet/knit - expression/repetition; programmable?
